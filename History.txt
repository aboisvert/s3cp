=== 1.1.3 (Pending)

* Fixed:   s3-to-s3 copy command failed with error message:
           `s3_to_s3': undefined local variable or method `s3_' for #<Object:0x7f333b239298> (NameError)


=== 1.1.2 / (2012-08-22)

* Added:   All commands now execute an init script ($HOME/.s3cp by default,
           or $S3CP_CONFIG if defined) allowing customization, such as
           setting up the AWS.config parameters such as S3 endpoints, max retries,
           credentials, etc.

           See http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSRubySDK/latest/AWS.html#config-class_method
           for details.

=== 1.1.1 / (2012-08-22)

* Fixed: Invalid break (SyntaxError) in s3ls.

=== 1.1.0 / (2012-08-22)

* First stable release using the aws-sdk gem.  No changes from 1.1.0.pre.4.

=== 1.1.0.pre.4 / (2012-08-22)

* Fixed:    s3dir was not correctly displaying directories

=== 1.1.0.pre.3 / (2012-08-22)

* Fixed:    s3cp >5GB file uploads (Peter Tan)

* Changed:  Updated aws-sdk dependency to ~> 1.6.3

=== 1.1.0.pre.2 / (2012-08-08)

* Added:    's3cp --version' now reports version information.

* Changed:  S3CP uses the default credential provider from aws-sdk which makes
            a best effort to locate your AWS credentials.  It checks a variety of
            locations in the following order:

              * Static credentials from AWS.config (e.g. AWS.config.access_key_id,
                AWS.config.secret_access_key)

              * The environment (e.g. ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] or
                ENV['AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID'])

              * EC2 metadata service (checks for credentials provided by
                roles for instances).

=== 1.1.0.pre.1 / (2012-07-23)

* Changed:  Underlying AWS library has been changed from 'right-aws' to the official
            AWS SDK ('aws-sdk').   The main driver for this is to stay current on the
            latest features, including instance-specific roles, temporary credentials,
            etc.

* Added:    New 's3buckets' command displays all S3 buckets associated with the
            account.

* Added:    New '--acl PERMISSION' option to 's3cp' and 's3up' commands.

=== 1.0.6 / (2012-07-23)

* Fixed:  s3cp would exit with errorlevel 0 despite errors when running in
          interactive mode.

=== 1.0.5 / (2012-06-25)

* Added:   New command 's3mv' to move files; s3mv is an alias to s3cp --move.

=== 1.0.4 / (2012-06-25)

* Fixed:  Potential "undefined method `finish' for nil:NilClass" error in s3cp.

=== 1.0.3 / (2012-05-11)

* Added:    Exponential backoff for `s3cp` command based on the formula:

              delay = initial_retry_delay * (factor ^ retries)

            where:
                    - `initial_retry_delay` is 1 second by default.
                    - `factor` is 1.4142 by default
                      (retry delay doubles every two retries)
                    - max. number of retries is now 20 by default.

            (which means s3cp retries for roughly 58 minutes by default)

* Fixed:  `s3ls` and `s3du` now properly handle Errno::EPIPE

* Fixed:  `s3du` would not display last character of files

=== 1.0.2 / 2012-03-9

* Added:  `s3up` now outputs uploaded file size to STDERR, e.g.,

          % ls | s3up s3://bucket/path/to/file
          s3://bucket/path/to/file => 214B

=== 1.0.1 / 2012-03-9

* Added:  New command `s3up` to upload STDIN to S3
          e.g. some_cmd | s3up s3://bucket/path/to/destination

  Note: `s3up` does not yet directly stream data to S3 since right_aws gem
        requires the upload size to be known in advance. `s3up` currently
        persists STDIN into a temp file although this may change in the
        future.

=== 1.0.0 / 2012-03-9

Pop the champagne!  It's time we called this a one-oh!! :)

S3CP now offers the feature set originally intended and it's been used reliably
by several people for several weeks and so deemed to be robust enough for
everyday use -- with the usual disclaimer that there are probably undiscovered
bugs -- but at least all known bugs have been addressed.

Probably worth mentioning: there are two outstanding experimental features,

1) s3cp --sync:  Does not handle missing files.  It's basically
                 a faster copy; not a true "sync" at this point.

2) Bash command-line completion is still very rough.

=== 0.2.7 / 2012-03-09

* Fixed #3: s3cp adds extra slash when copying to the root of a bucket.
            e.g. s3://myBucket//someFile or s3://myBucket//someFolderToCopy/someFile

=== 0.2.6 / 2012-03-06

* Fixed:  Possible division-by-zero error in s3du if it encounters
          zero-length files.

=== 0.2.5 / 2012-03-02

* Added: "s3du" command to calculate disk usage.
         Supports --depth, --regex, --unit parameters and more!

* Changed: "s3ls -l" command now accepts --unit and --precision to configure
           file size display.  Uses "smart" unit by default.

* Changed: "s3ls -l" will now use S3CP_DATE_FORMAT environment if set.

=== 0.2.4 / 2012-02-27

* Fixed: Handling of relative paths in s3cp.

  % s3cp -r bucket:path/to/files /local/path

  will now produce local files:

     /local/path/files/A
     /local/path/files/B
     /local/path/files/C
     /local/path/files2/D
     /local/path/files2/E
     ...

  whereas,

  % s3cp -r bucket:path/to/files/ /local/path


    /local/path/A
    /local/path/B
    /local/path/C
    ...

  (note the trailing slash on "bucket:path/to/files")

=== 0.2.3 / (2012-02-24)

* Added: --include and --exclude REGEX support for s3cp

* Added: --sync mode for s3cp

=== 0.2.2 / (2012-02-23)

* Added: Progress bars during upload/download if $stdout.isatty

* Fixed: s3cat now handles broken pipes properly
         e.g. "s3cat bucket:some/file | head" will now terminate early.

=== 0.2.1 / (2012-02-20)

* Added: Bash completion now supports exclusions through S3CP_EXCLUDES
         and defaults to excluding keys containing "_$folder$".

* Changed: s3dir and s3ls --delimiter now display both directories and files

=== 0.2.0 / (2012-02-20)

* Added: s3stat command to display S3 object properties

* Added: s3dir as a shortcut for "s3ls --delimiter / ..."
         (default to character in S3CP_DELIMITER environment variable or "/" if not defined)

* Added: s3cp defaults can now be set using environment variables
         S3CP_OVERWRITE, S3CP_CHECKSUM, S3CP_RETRIES, S3CP_RETRY_DELAY

* Added: Support for Bash command-line completion of S3 URLs (see below).

* Fixed: Skip checksum verification for S3 objects with invalid MD5's
         (details @ https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=234538)

To install Bash completion for S3 URLs, add the following to ~/.bashrc:

  for cmd in [ s3cat s3cp s3dir s3ls s3mod s3rm s3stat ]; do
    complete -C s3cp_complete $cmd
  done

=== 0.1.15 / (2012-02-17)

* Added: s3cp now automatically checks MD5 checksums during download/upload
         and retries up to 5 times by default if the checksum fails.
         The number of attempts may be configured using --max-attempts,
         the retry delay may be changed with --retry-delay and the check
         may be disabled completely using --no-checksum.

=== 0.1.14 / (2012-02-09)

* Fixed:  --date-format argument didn't work correctly

=== 0.1.13 / (2012-02-06)

* Long-listing (-l) now displays file size (in bytes).

=== 0.1.12 / (2012-02-03)

* Re-released 0.1.11 due to misfire.

=== 0.1.11 / (2012-02-03)

* Added:  s3cp --no-overwrite option to prevent overwriting existing files.

=== 0.1.10 / (2012-01-24)

* Fixed: --max-keys now works correctly with --delimiter
* Fixed: do not display any keys if there are no common-prefix
         delimiter-matching keys

=== 0.1.9 / (2012-01-23)

* Added:  s3ls now accepts --max-keys and --delimiter parameters.

=== 0.1.8 / (2011-12-29)

* Fixed:  Apparently, File.new(path, File::CREAT|File::WRONLY) does not
          truncate existing files; use File.new(path, "wb") instead.

=== 0.1.7 / (2011-12-29)

* Fixed:  s3cp would not truncate existing files when overwriting, possibly
          resulting in corrupted files.

=== 0.1.6 / (2011-12-16)

* Changed: s3rm now uses multi-object delete operation for faster deletes
* Changed: dependency on 'aboisvert-aws' instead of 'right-aws' until
           it supports multi-object delete.

=== 0.1.5 / 2011-10-17

* Fixed:  All commands now work properly on Ruby 1.8.x

=== 0.1.4 / 2011-10-17

* Added:  s3rm command

=== 0.1.3 / 2011-09-29

* Fixed:  s3cp --headers names are now converted to lowercase since underlying
          RightAWS gem expects lowercase header names.

=== 0.1.2 / 2011-09-29

* Added:   s3cp now supports passing --headers (Donnie Flood)
* Changed: s3ls now displays entries with s3://@bucket/ prefix

=== 0.1.1 / 2011-09-22

* Added:  s3mod command (Josh Carver)

=== 0.1 / 2011-04-05

* First release
